# hangman
A simple text-based hangman program.

I will expand on this in the near future once school is over.

Things I have planned:
-make it object oriented (this was just something I coded in one session)
-implement a solver/guesser function that makes optimal guesses
-try to use everything I learned in my programming methodologies class
